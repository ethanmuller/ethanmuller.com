    <h2>Using Pico-8</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Trapped in a black screen with text? Press <key>esc</key> on the keyboard to open up the editor</li>
      <li>Type everything in lowercase, make sure <key>caps lock</key> is off</li>
      <li>Press <key>ctrl + r</key> to run your program</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Editor</h2>
    <p>The scariest part of making games is arguably writing code. As you're learning to write code, <strong>take baby steps.</strong> If you're only making small changes, you'll never have big problems.</p>

    <p>If you break down coding into smaller steps, here's what it looks like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make a change to your code</li>
      <li>Take a guess about what effect your change will have</li>
      <li>Run your code with <key>ctrl + r</key></li>
      <li>Look at what changed. Is it what you expected?</li>
      <li>Repeat, over and over and over</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you do this enough times, you can make a game. The hard part is knowing what changes to make in the first place. This comes with practice.</p>

    <p>Pico-8 games are made up of 3 main functions:</p>

    <div class="code-block"><pre><code>function _init()
end

function _update()
end

function _draw()
end</code></pre></div>
      <p>If you're copy and pasting code, <strong>make sure you only have one of each of these functions.</strong> If you define the <code>_draw()</code> function twice, only the second one will take effect, and you will confuse yourself.</p>

      <h3>How To Count</h3>

      <p>We make a variable <code>count</code> to hold a number. Then we update it by adding one to it and assigning to itself. And then we draw it by using <code>print(count)</code></p>

    <div class="code-block"><pre><code>function _init()
  count = 0
end

function _update()
  count = count + 1
end

function _draw()
  print(count)
end</code></pre></div>
      <p>See how the numbers seem to scroll up really fast? We can make the number "stay in place" by clearing the screen every frame with <code>cls()</code></p>
    <div class="code-block"><pre><code>function _init()
  count = 0
end

function _update()
  count = count + 1
end

function _draw()
  cls()
  print(count)
end</code></pre></div>

  <h3>How To Draw</h3>

  <p>Pico-8 has built-in pixel art tools, but you can also use code to draw basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines. Let's use the <code>circfill()</code> function to draw a filled-in circle.</p>

  <div class="code-block"><pre><code>function _draw()
  cls()
  circfill(64, 64, 10, 8)
end</code></pre></div>
    <p>The first two arguments set the position. The third argument sets the radius. The fourth argument sets the color. Try tweaking these to see how the circle responds.</p>

  <h3>How To Draw And Count At The Same Time</h3>
  <p>Did you try tweaking the numbers previous example? Once you get a feel for what each number does, you'll be ready for this next example: changing the circle's values <em>with code</em> instead of by hand.</p>

  <p>If we take the counting example from before, we can plug our <code>count</code> variable into the <code>circfill</code> function and get movement.</p>

  <div class="code-block"><pre><code>function _init()
  count = 0
end

function _update()
  count = count + 1
end

function _draw()
  cls()
  print(count)
  circfill(count, 64, 10, 8)
end</code></pre></div>
  <p>Look at that circle go. Wonder where he's going?</p>

    <h2>Sprite Editor</h2>
    <p>This is where you draw the art for your game. This is arguably the funnest panel. Sprites are usually drawn as 8x8 graphics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right click to grab color from canvas</li>
      <li>Scroll mouse wheel to zoom in and out</li>
      <li><key>ctrl</key> + click to replace colors (this is like the fill tool, but colors don't have to be touching)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Map Editor</h2>
    <p>This is where you put down objects in a grid to create a game world.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Press <key>tab</key> to show full screen</li>
      <li>Hold <key>space</key> then click and drag to pan</li>
      <li>Not every game needs a map</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SFX/Pattern Editor:</h2>
    <p>This is where you can input notes to make little bits of music and sound effects.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sound effects and music patterns are the same thing. Sound effects are just music patterns played really fast</li>
      <li><em>SPD</em> (speed) might work differently than you expect: low numbers are faster, higher numbers are slower. Click the number to increase, right click to decrease</li>
      <li>Press <key>TAB</key> to change view between <strong>Sound Effect View</strong> and <strong>Music Tracker View</strong></li>
      <li>Press <key>space</key> to play</li>
      <li><strong>Sound Effect View:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Click and drag to draw out a sound effect</li>
          <li>Higher is higher pitched, lower is lower pitched</li>
          <li>Strip at the bottom sets volume. Delete notes by setting volume to 0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In <strong>Music Tracker View</strong> here's how your computer keyboard maps to a piano keyboard:</p>

    <h2>Music Editor</h2>
    <p>This is where you string together patterns into musical arrangements. You can play 4 different voices at a time, so think about how to break apart your musical ideas.</p>
