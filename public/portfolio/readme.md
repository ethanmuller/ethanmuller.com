# Portfolio

No, your eyes don't deceive you. This here is PHP code.

When originally coding my portfolio, I obviously had no idea what I was
doing. I used PHP so I could put reused bits in partials and keep my website manageable.
Feast your eyes on that `pieces.ini` file. Mmmm. It's kind of beautiful in a weird way.

This obviously ain't gonna run out of the box without some configuration.
