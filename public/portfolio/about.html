					<p class="about">
						I’ve been working with graphics since I was a five-year-old.
						Countless hours of my childhood were spent playing around with MS Paint
						on the family's giant gray Gateway computer.
						Since then, I've developed a keen eye for details <i>(I'm one of those perfectionists),</i>
						I've upgraded my software <i>(now I use Adobe CS5),</i>
						and I've learned the ins and outs of web design <i>(I have a thing for clean HTML5/CSS).</i>
						Currently I'm living in Dayton, Ohio.
						If you have any questions, comments, or cute puppy pictures to share with me,
						please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a>
